What is a Trie?
A Trie is a data structure that is used for finding a specific set of strings quickly.
This searching algorithm uses individual nodes to represent characters in the alphabet. 
Every node can have 26 children, 1 for each charcter in the english alphabet. Each node 
is inserted in alphabetical order, so the tree is probarly sorted. A Trie will typically
have 3 methods, one for insertion, deletion, and searching.

Pros:
-Has alphabetical sorting, so printing words in alphabetical order can be done 
quickly.
-A Trie will be able to insert, sort, and delete any given node in O(n) time.

Cons:
-A Trie takes up a mass amount of space in many cases, as each node can have
many children which leads inefficient space usage.
-A well constructed hash table is able to lookup a value with a best case of O(1) 
which is far faster than a Trie.
